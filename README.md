# Routing & Switching LAB
Objective
Configure OSPF, EIGRP, ACLs, and VLANs using your Cisco vIOS router, NXOSv9k switch, and 3 virtual PCs in EVE-NG.

Topology Overview:
- **Cisco NXOS Switch**: Acts as a core switch with VLANs configured for segmentation.
- **Cisco vIOS Router**: Provides routing between VLANs and runs both OSPF and EIGRP to demonstrate routing protocols.
- **3 Virtual PCs**: Placed in separate VLANs to simulate devices in different network segments.
